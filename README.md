# Nola.com Atom Feed Bridge

## What is it?
Nola.com, a local New Orleans news website, no longer has a working RSS feed and
does not appear to have any plans to fix the existing feed.
This tool scrapes the nola.com website, and converts it into an Atom feed.
Nolabridge can either be run localy, self hosted, or you can point your rss reader
to the [hosted feed](https://nola.rss.idlecore.dev).
